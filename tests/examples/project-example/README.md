CX can run full directories. For example, if you are inside the directory in a terminal, which have the main.cx then run:

```
cx main.cx math.cx
```

But, If you are one level up in the directory hierarchy, then run:

```
cx main.cx dir/.../math.cx


This project-example will show you how you can organize a project folder. You can create different packages in this folder and use them all in the package main. As shown in the examples 

Here we created a math package and imported it into the main package
